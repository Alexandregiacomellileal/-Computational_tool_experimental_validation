### Low-Frequency Fall-of-Potential Method using Flat-slope-rule

In Figure 1, we illustrate the application of the Fall-of-Potential (FoP) method to measure the low-frequency grounding resistance in our case study grounding system. The measuring leads have been laid along a line orthogonal to the horizontal electrode's length. A voltage $V$ (V) was applied by a low-frequency instrument between the electrode of interest (EE) and the auxiliary current-return electrode (CE), inducing a current $I$ (A) to circulate. To minimize mutual resistances, the CE was strategically placed at a substantial distance XC (m) 45 meters from EE.

Next, a Potential Electrode (PE) was positioned at a distance XP (m) from the current injection point in EE. The precise placement of the PE termed the compensation point, is crucial. It must be free from the influences of both the EE and CE. To ensure this, we systematically moved the PE in 0.1XC increments between EE and CE, capturing resistance reading at each step. The detection of three consecutive, evenly spaced, and constant resistance readings (differences lower than 3%) was indicative of true EE grounding resistance, a principle known as the Flat-slope-rule [^4]. For comparison purposes with other approaches aiming to estimate just the individual grounding resistances of turbines in the case study's grounding system, the FoP low-frequency measurements were taken at three different current injection points in EE, identified as 1, 2, and 3. However, it is essential to highlight that such a value is representative of the true grounding resistance of the entire grounding system of the case study.

A common issue in measuring grounding resistance at the specific frequency of 25 kHz is the pronounced coupling effect between the leads connected to auxiliary electrodes for current and potential. This effect becomes particularly significant when these leads are laid in parallel within the ground. To address this challenge, it is recommended to adopt the configuration outlined in Figure 2. In this setup, the auxiliary electrodes for the current and the potential probes should be positioned in opposite directions along a line orthogonal to the horizontal electrode direction. This arrangement mitigates the coupling effect, providing a more accurate measurement of grounding resistance at 25 kHz [^1].

## Measurement Data and Percentage Error

Actual Rf represents the actual turbine grounding resistance, and $Zmed_{method}$ represents the estimated turbine grounding resistance by the measurement method. The "Percentage Error" is then calculated as $((Zmed_{method} - Rf) / Rf) * 100$.
